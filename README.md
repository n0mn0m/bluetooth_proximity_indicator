Getting Started:

This project provides a loop to run on the CircuitPlayground Bluefruit that attempts to pair with Apple devices and then monitors SMS notifactions
for valid colors to change the neopixels.

Requires [CircuitPlayground](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_bluefruit/)>=5.0

See the ./lib directory for CircuitPlayground library dependencies. For newer versions of libraries check [here](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

For more information and Bluefruit tutorials checkout [Adafruits](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/overview) CircuitPlayground Bluefruit docs.
